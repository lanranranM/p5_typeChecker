**files details**
**ast.java:** we added typeCheck() to nodes to check if the type is correct. If the node meet the error from its children, it not report and pass up the error. If there is a type inompatibility, we create a new errorType() object and report it and pass up the error. For details, plz check the comments in the files.
**P5.java**: the main program will parse, do nameAnalyzer, do typeChecker, and unparse. There need to be 2 command-line arguments: the file to be parse and the output file. The parsed ast would be printed in the output file and any error message would be outputed to stdout. Note that if there are type errors, the final return code would be 0.
**test.b**: conatins all valid name cases.
**typeErrors.b**: contains error cases.
